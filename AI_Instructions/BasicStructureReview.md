Basic Structure Review
============

The ZZermelo project is a php-based reporting engine that is currently focused on reporting against the MariaDB database.
Please read ZZermelo/ReadMe.md and ZZermelo/FullFeature.md

It has an example project in LoreCommander/ which is a project to do data reports against the Magic The Gathering card dataset from Scryfall.
To start read all of the files in LoreCommander/app/Reports that do not begin with "DURC_". This will give you a good idea of what the reporting engine is trying to accomplish.

Before we discuss a specific task, please review the structure of the project.

Read all of the content in ZZermelo/documentation

Then read ZZermelo/composer.json to understand the core underlying infrastructure for the project.

When this is done, please ask any questions you need to in order to understand the project more fully.

Do not modify these instructions as you work.
